# Handoff

## Summary

Project planning environment was initialized from `IDEA.md`. No product code exists yet beyond `pyproject.toml`; `README.md` is empty.

## Read First

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `SPEC.md`
3. `DESIGN.md`
4. `TODO.md`
5. `.spec/state.md`
6. `.spec/checks.md`
7. `.spec/handoff.md`
8. `.mem/hot.md`
9. `.mem/decisions.md`
10. `.mem/open-loops.md`

## Current Direction

Build `sipx` as a Python Voice/SIP Harness:

- Harness core is product center.
- AsteriskBackend is first implementation path.
- NativeSipBackend is required for technical softphone and raw SIP/RTP validation.
- Scenario, expect, timeline, verdict, and artifacts come before full telephony feature breadth.
- Package/import name and CLI command are both `sipx`.
- Technical softphone should be built on `NativeSipBackend`, not Asterisk.
- Technical softphone should be headless first and support profiles, lab hooks, scenario recording, and replay.
- Mixed scenarios should support native actors and Asterisk actors in one timeline.
- PJSIP/PJSUA2 is optional future backend, not the native protocol-lab foundation.
- Maintained English files in the current structure are the implementation source of truth; `IDEA.md` is historical only; no separate `/docs` tree is used.

## Recommended Next Task

Start with `TODO.md` Milestone 0:

1. Choose first Asterisk media path.
2. Implement `sipx/core` skeleton.
3. Add `MockBackend` and first CLI command.

## Do Not Do Yet

- Do not build full SIP stack before core harness abstractions.
- Do not couple public API to Asterisk.
- Do not write real Asterisk secrets/config with credentials.
- Do not use AI semantic assertions as the only pass/fail check.
